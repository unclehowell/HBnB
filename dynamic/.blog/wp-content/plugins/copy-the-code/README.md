### Documentation

**1. How it Works?**

Simply, It search the `<pre>` tag within the page and add the `Copy` button within it.

**2. It add `Copy` button for each `<pre>` tag?**

Yes, Once you activate the plugin it add search the `<pre>` tag and add the `Copy` button in it.

**3. Can I use another selector instead of `<pre>` tag?**

Yes, You can change the selector though filter `copy_the_code_localize_vars`.

Eg. If you want to enable the `Copy` button for only single page, post etc. Then You can change the selector `body.single pre` though filter.

<pre>
add_filter( 'copy_the_code_localize_vars', 'my_slug_copy_the_code_localize_vars' );
function my_slug_copy_the_code_localize_vars( $defaults )
{
	// `single class is added to the `<body>` tag for the single page, post etc.
	$defaults['selector'] = 'body.single pre';

	return $defaults;	
}
</pre>

**4. Plugin compatible for all themes?**

Yes, We have added `!important` for the Copy button to keep the button style same for each theme. We have tested below themes.
