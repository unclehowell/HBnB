== Installation ==

1. Install the <code>Copy Anything to Clipboard</code> plugin either via the WordPress plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server at <code>wp-content/plugins</code>.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How it Works? =

After plugin install and activate, By default on front-end the `Copy` button is added for all the `<pre>` tags.

On click on it the content within the `pre` tags is copy in clipboard.

= What is selector? =

Selector is the target element in which we want to add the copy button. It should be any valid CSS selector.

= Some Examples of Selectors? =

Lets check below some selectors which are valid to use:

- `pre` - Copy button added all the `pre` tags.
- `.single pre` - Copy button added only if its parent have CSS class `.single`.
- `#my-account-section-1 pre` - Copy button added only if its parent have CSS class `#my-account-section-1`.

= Can I change the copied content? =

Yes, By default the content are copied as HTML. We can change it as Text so content copied without HTML tags.

= Can I default copy button string's? =

Yes, We can change the default strings of the button text, button copied text and the title of the button too.

= Can I change the copy button position?

Yes, By default the button is added within the selector. But, We can change it outside the selector.

= Can I change the selector with filter? =

Yes, We can use the `copy_the_code_localize_vars` selector to change the currently stored selector.

E.g.

<pre>
add_filter( 'copy_the_code_localize_vars', 'my_slug_copy_the_code_localize_vars' );
function my_slug_copy_the_code_localize_vars( $defaults )
{
	// `single class is added to the `<body>` tag for the single page, post etc.
	$defaults['selector'] = 'body.single pre';

	return $defaults;	
}
</pre>

= Is plugin compatible for all the themes? =

Yes, We have added `!important` for the Copy button to keep the button style same for each theme. We have tested below themes.
