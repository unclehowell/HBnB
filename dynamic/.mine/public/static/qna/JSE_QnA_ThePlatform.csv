Why do I keep being asked to enter my username and password?","This shouldn't be happening to the platform. The 2 common reasons users find that cause this are; - 1. Refreshing the page to check on earnings. By refreshing you are effectively leaving the page and reentering and so will be required to log in again. This is a fairly standard security feature. - 2. You are signing into your account on a second device. Users are limited to one device, and as soon as a second login is made you will be logged out of the first account."

This enables you to mine in one and then perform other functions such as checking your balance, making payments transfers etc, in another. However there is no benefit to mining in all 3 at the same time, and there are restrictions in place to prevent an increase in earnings, you will simply just be wasting electricity and mobile data etc."

I forgot my pin, can you reset it?",It's not possible to restore a PIN. It’s a 4-12 digit number and most people use a common number that is familiar to them. We suggest trying a few. You get 3 attempts per six hour period but nothing bad will happen if you get it wrong other than you run out of guesses. The team here have to deal with this a lot because we don’t offer email reset on the pin number (because it’s designed to prevent loss of funds if an email account is compromised) and almost everyone gets it right within a few attempts.
