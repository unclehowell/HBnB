All my referrals are getting declined, how come?
I'm sending referrals but they are getting declined for no reason
Why is my referral bonus getting declined based on risk score?","This could be for a few reasons;
- your referral is not from one of our accepted countries as listed on the referrals page.
- your referral already has an account registered at the same IP address. Duplicate IP accounts aren't paid the bonus as this would leave the system open to abuse.
-Your referral has registered using a non residential IP address including VPNâ€™s. Again, allowing referrals to register via a VPN would leave the system open to abuse.
- Your referral has been matched to fraud patterns by the machine learning system resulting in a risk score beyond the acceptable level."
