General Enquiries,"Why should I use a unique password for the JSEcoin platform?
What is the need for password security?
Do I need to use a unique password?
Is my account secure?
Can my password be hacked?
What happens if I use the same password for everything?","You should use a different password for every platform that you register with. Users who use the same email address and password for every account risk having their accounts hacked. This is because high profile hacks leaked databases of email/password combos which are now available to hackers. Yahoo, Linkedin, Sony, AOL, Equifax have all been breached in the past and user account data is in the hands of hackers. Financial platforms are particularly targetable by hackers for obvious reasons. Take care of your account, use a unique password and setup two factor authentication using an application like Google Authenticator. This advice goes for all platforms across the web and not just specifically JSEcoin."

You can refer friends and colleagues using the affiliate links available via the platform, there's even a simple social share button to tweet or share on Facebook. Finally you can help our team develop the platform by reporting any security vulnerabilities here https://jsecoin.com/en/oddJobs/bugBounty."

General Enquiries,"I see that you are using the SHA256 hashing algorithm. What prevents ASIC devices and server farms from taking over?
Is the mining proof of work pow?
How are rewards distributed?
Is JSEcoin ASIC resistent
Can JSEcoin be minedby servers and ASIC devices?
How does the mining algorithm work?","Rewards are distributed via a unique random lottery system with restrictions in place meaning that finding more hashes or hashes with a greater number of leading zeros will not lead to an increase in earnings. Therefore there would no benefit to using an ASIC device, and money would simply be wasted on electricity."
