Our ambition is to create an energy efficient cryptocurrency mined by webmasters which is adopted globally by mainstream users.
  
All major cryptocurrencies currently rely on miners to carry out the cryptography hashing. Hashing is a mathematical equation that is carried out at large scale to secure a blockchain which is the underlying transaction database of a cryptocurrency. This process consumes huge amounts of computing power and electricity and is dominated by server farms. Miners are rewarded for their efforts by the distribution of the currency.
  
It is possible to carry out SHA256 and other encryption in a standard web browser or on a mobile device. By embedding a javascript snippet on a website all visitors to the website could carry out the hashing encryption process, which when combined at scale could​ ​replace​ ​the role​ ​of​ ​the​ ​miners​. Website owners would then be rewarded by the distribution of the currency. We have estimated 1 in 15 people either own or have access to a website which provides a large distribution and potential client base.
  
By using surplus CPU power, huge energy and cost savings could be made over traditional cryptocurrency networks.
  
As part of this we also offer the ability for users without website to mine JSECoin. They can do this by accessing the JSECoin platform and act as miners through either a Web Browser, Desktop or Mobile App.
