				"faqItemContent1": "We are currently integrating the platform with an ERC20 compatible Ethereum smart contract. This will be compatible with all 3rd party ERC20 compatible wallets such as myetherwallet, metamask, parity etc. For most users we recommend storing your tokens on the web platform and using strong security practices on your account such as unique passwords and two factor authentication.",
				"faqItemHeading2": "I've lost my two factor authentication code, what can I do?",
				"faqItemContent2": "If you have lost your phone or access to your 2fa codes we recommend reinstalling Google Authenticator or Authy on a new device and signing in with your gmail account to access your codes. If this doesn't work we will require photo identification matching the name and address used when you signed up for an account along with answering some security questions. Please note 2fa is a security feature and we reserve the right to decline requests to reset it if we are not 100% satisfied that the case is genuine.",
				"faqItemHeading3": "Why should I use a unique password for the JSEcoin platform?",
				"faqItemContent3": "You should use a different password for every platform that you register with. Users who use the same email address and password for every account risk having their accounts hacked. This is because high profile hacks leaked databases of email/password combos which are now available to hackers. Yahoo, Linkedin, Sony, AOL, Equifax have all been breached in the past and user account data is in the hands of hackers. Financial platforms are particularly targetable by hackers for obvious reasons. Take care of your account, use a unique password and setup two factor authentication using an application like Google Authenticator. This advice goes for all platforms across the web and not just specifically JSEcoin.",
				"faqItemHeading4": "Why is my ad-blocker/anti-virus software is blocking JSEcoin.com?",
				"faqItemContent4": "Some ad blockers and anti-virus companies have bundled us in with hidden background mining scripts that mine on a users PC without them knowing. We are actively campaigning and lobbying the organisations that are blocking our domains. If you would like to help please contact your software provider and ask for an exception to be made.",
				"faqItemHeading5": "How can I earn JSEcoin cryptocurrency tokens using just my PC?",
				"faqItemContent5": "There are a number of ways to earn JSE. You can try the self-mining which runs a mathematical hashing process on your laptop in the background while you work. Rewards are distributed via a lottery system to the miners. If you have a website you can earn JSE by placing the code snippet on your site and getting visitors to mine for you while you sleep. You can refer friends and colleagues using the affiliate links available via the platform, there's even a simple social share button to tweet or share on Facebook.

				"faqItemContent7": "No and we wouldn't like to take a guess at this because it relies on external factors out of our control. It is an extremely volatile market where values can change by large amounts in very short spaces of time.",
				"faqItemHeading8": "Pre-ICO tokens were sold at a value of 1JSE = $1, what will be the value for your ICO?",
				"faqItemContent8": "It is difficult to say at this stage but the value will be determined by demand and market conditions at the time of the ICO. We are working hard to create a platform that will be in high demand and deliver a good return to all early investors.",
				"faqItemHeading9": "If JSEcoin is a coin on its own, is it listed on Coinmarketcap?",

				"faqItemHeading5": "How are publishers rewarded for running the script on their sites?",
				"faqItemContent5": "Rewards are distributed via a lottery system where publishers earn lottery tickets for unique visitors, page views and hashes found. 50 x 1 JSE are then randomly distributed to ticket holders. This lottery repeats with each 30 second block delivering 144,000 JSE tokens in total each day.",

				"faqItemContent6": "No! We don't want to give publishers control of how much of a users cpu the mining uses. Currently it is set to use the minimal amount so that it does not have a noticeable impact on their browsing experience. We wouldn't want webmasters to be able to increase the cpu usage as this could give JSEcoin a bad reputation. Webmasters earnings are dependent on visitors, unique visitors as well as hashes found and so cpu usage is set to the minimum required in order to secure the blockchain.",
				"faqItemHeading7": "Is it possible to prevent the JSEcoin banner from appearing on my site?",
				"faqItemContent7": "This is actually the privacy notification. It is important for us that this notification must appear when a user first visits your site (and once per hour after that) as we want to operate in a transparent way so that users are clearly being told that the mining is taking place, and that an opt out is available. We feel that this is important for legal and ethical reasons and that this openness will help the idea become more widely accepted. It is one of our terms of use that publishers must display the notification and not make any attempt to hide it.",
				"faqItemHeading8": "Is there any specific legalese we need to put on our site?",
				"faqItemContent8": "This is new technology, we haven't had any legal issues or guidance to contend with. The privacy notice is displayed by default and is essential because it contains the option to opt-out across the entire network. If you wish to place something in your own website terms this would help with transparency. ",

Our system is similar to traditional cryptocurrencies but instead of big server farms we carry out the hashing algorithm in website visitors browsers. This is unobtrusive and runs behind the scenes (except for a privacy notification) so it does not negatively affect the user experience or page load speeds for your website visitors.",

We are targeting an ICO and exchange listing in 2018, you will then be able to transfer JSEcoin to the exchanges and swap for Bitcoin/USD etc. While there will never be a better time to mine cryptocurrency because competition is low, you wont be able to spend the earnings until JSE is listed on exchanges. Also worth noting is that if something goes wrong with JSE or the cryptocurrency markets in general we may never reach the liquidity stage and the tokens will be worthless. This is the risk that early adopters are facing.",

				"faqItemContent1": "No, we are trying to avoid both scenarios. Basically the self-mining is meant to be a way for individual users to get involved with cryptocurrency and be fun for everyone. We want to avoid going down the path of multiple user accounts and multiple devices because this will eventually lead to server farms, bot nets etc. and wont benefit everyone. You risk having your account(s) closed and we take active measures to prevent this kind of activity.",
				"faqItemHeading2": "How many tokens are available each day and how are they distributed?",
				"faqItemContent2": "Finding valid hashes earns you a ticket into into a lottery system where 50 winners get rewarded a 1 JSE token. This lottery takes place every 30 seconds, with a new 50 x 1JSE available each time. This adds up to 144,000 JSE available each day. ",
				"faqItemHeading3": "Why does the hash rate drop significantly when I visit other tabs?",
				"faqItemContent3": "To overcome this we recommend that you open the mining in a new browser with no other tabs open. If you then want to continue to different sites instead of opening a new tab, you should open up a new browser. This should stop the drop in hash rate. Try different browsers, your optimal browser will depend on your system. Chrome and Firefox are both recommended. We are currently finishing off a desktop app which users will be able to use to mine which will also completely solve this problem.",
				"faqItemHeading4": "What is the Hash Rate Accelerator?",
				"faqItemContent4": "This is a simple slider function that allows you to increase or decrease the amount of cpu power that you dedicate to the mining process. If you want to continue using your computer then you may want to turn this down, or you can crank it up if you have nothing else to do on your device. Please note that at present there is no real benefit to earnings by going over 10K h/s and so setting the hash rate accelerator to deliver more that this is not recommended.",
				"faqItemHeading5": "If my flatmate and I both mine at the same time are earnings affected as we are using the same IP address?",
				"faqItemContent5": "As part of our fraud prevention and to ensure server farms can’t take over JSEcoin, we have had to put IP restrictions in place. We have limited it to one lottery ticket per block per IP address. This means that multiple users will be able to mine in the same location, however potential rewards will be split between them."
