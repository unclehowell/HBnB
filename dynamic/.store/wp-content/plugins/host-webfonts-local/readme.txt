With only 2 clicks of a button, OMGF automagically downloads your Google Fonts you want to WordPress' content-folder, generates a stylesheet for it and enqueues it in your theme's header.

== Description ==

> How could using fonts via Google's service possibly run afoul of GDPR? The fact of the matter is that, when a font is requested by the user's browser, their IP is logged by Google and used for analytics.
> â€” Lifehacker

Leverage Browser Cache, Minimize DNS requests and serve your Google Fonts in a 100% GDPR compliant way with OMGF!

OMGF is written with performance and user-friendliness in mind. It uses the Google Fonts Helper API to automagically download the fonts you want to WordPress' contents folder and generate a stylesheet for it. The stylesheet is automatically included to your site's header and 100% compatible with CSS and JS optimizing/minification plugins like Autoptimize or W3 Total Cache. OMGF can efficiently remove any requests to external Google Fonts (loaded from fonts.gstatic.com or fonts.googleapies.com).

That's it. You're done!

This will *decrease your pageload times*, *leverage browser cache*, *minimize DNS requests* and effectively bring you a perfect score on *Pagespeed Insights* and *Pingdom*, without taking toll on the performance of your webserver.

Please keep in mind that, although I try to make the configuration of this plugin as easy as possible, the concept of locally hosting a file or optimizing Google Fonts for *Pagespeed Insights* or *GT Metrix* has proven to be confusing for some people. If you're not sure of what your doing, please consult a SEO expert or Webdeveloper to help you with the configuration of this plugin or [hire me to do it for you](https://woosh.dev/wordpress-services/omgf-expert-configuration/).

== Features ==
- *Automatically detect* which Google Fonts your theme is using or,
- Easily find fonts in multiple subsets,
- Download them and generate a stylesheet, which is automatically added to your header using WordPress' wp_head()-function,
- Change the caching path (where the fonts and stylesheet are saved) for increased compatibility with Multisite environments and Caching- and Security-plugins, such as WP Super Cache, Autoptimize and WordFence,
- Serve your fonts from your CDN,
- Enable Typekit's [Web Font Loader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) to load your fonts asynchronously and further increase your Pagespeed Insights score (!),
- Preload the entire stylesheet or just fonts loaded above-the-fold,
- Control font performance by adding font-display property,
- Auto-generates the local source for webfonts,
- Automatically remove any fonts loaded from fonts.gstatic.com or fonts.googleapis.com.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/host-webfonts-local` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Settings -> Optimize Webfonts screen to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't know what I'm doing! Can you help? =

Of course :) But first calm down and read this [comprehensive guide on how to configure OMGF](https://daan.dev/wordpress/host-google-fonts-locally/). If you have any questions afterwards, visit the [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/host-webfonts-local).

= I have another file I want to host locally. Could you make a plugin? =

Maintaining three plugins besides my daily 9-to-5 job is a handful, so no. If you're looking for a way to host analytics.js locally; please install [CAOS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/host-analyticsjs-local/). To host other 3rd party scripts and styles locally, try [HELL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/host-everything-local/). For anything else, please follow the steps in [this how-to](https://daan.dev/how-to/host-js-locally-crontab/).

= How come my font isn't available in OMGF? =

This could be for several reasons:
1. Have you checked if your font is available on Google Fonts?
1. Is your font listed as an open source font, or is it a premium font? For obvious reasons, OMGF only has access to open source fonts.

= Can I serve the fonts from my CDN? =

Yes, you can. Enter the url of your CDN and re-download and re-generate the stylesheet. Then the fonts will be saved to and served from your CDN.

= How can I make sure the fonts load asynchronously AKA non-render blocking?

Enable Typekit's Web Font Loader in the settings and OMGF will take care of it for you!

= I'm getting a 'Load resources from a consistent URL' after installing and configuring this plugin. What's going on? =

This must be, because you're still loading the externally hosted Google Fonts, besides the fonts you downloaded using OMGF. Try checking the option 'Remove Google Fonts' and see if that helps. If it doesn't consider using a child theme to 'dequeue' any external requests. If you don't know how to do that, please [contact](https://daan.dev/contact/) me.

= I have 'Remove Google Fonts' enabled, but the fonts from fonts.gstatic.com|fonts.googleapis.com are still loaded. What's going on? =

The option in OMGF removes any fonts that are loaded in the conventional way. However, if it doesn't work for you and you're using a popular theme, I'd love to help and make OMGF compatible. So don't hesitate to [contact](https://daan.dev/contact/) me.

= Does this plugin edit template files? =

No, it does not. It creates a CSS Stylesheet which will be automatically added to your theme's header using a built-in WordPress queueing system.

= The stylesheet isn't loaded? What's going on? =

OMGF enqueues the stylesheet into WordPress' head. If the stylesheet isn't loaded, this probably means your theme isn't implementing the wp_head() function into it's header section.

= Does this plugin support Multi Site? I'm getting CORS errors! =

Yes, it does. When using subdomains, however, you might run into CORS related issues. To get around this, you should configure each site separately. Do the following:

- Go to the site's own dashboard,
- Change OMGF's cache directory (*Save webfonts to...*) to something unique, e.g. `/cache/site1/omgf`,
- Click 'Save Changes',
- If you haven't already, find the fonts you want to use,
- Click 'Download Fonts' and wait for the process to finish,
- Click 'Generate stylesheet'.

Repeat this for every site you want to use with OMGF. A new stylesheet, using the corresponding site's Home-URL and cache directory for each font, has been generated. Bypassing any Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues you might run into.

= Is this plugin compatible with WPML? =

No, not yet. But I will definitely try to make it compatible in the future!
