# Docs

This docs directory contains the docs (wordpress) website. 
The point of the docs website is to showcase the docs library.
 
## Uploading/ Downloading

In the Top Level Directory there's a guide called COLLABORATE.md
The guide explains how you checkout this folder and its contents.

## passwords

Downloading: Default username/password is `admin` and `secret`
Uploading: Remember to restore the defaults before you `git push`.

Don't `git init` the directory on your local or remote server. 
Or you risk uploading your passwords to the public repo.
Or downloading the default password and lowering your security.
