Keeping the old business plans here, regardless of the new method of archieving e.g. '0-0-1', '0-0-2' & 'latest' etc
Because there is no archieved latex document folder, only PDF's of the older documents. 
Within these PDF's are links (which cannot be changed) to the older archieve directory location. 
Which is why these files must remain here. At least until the old PDF has been reverse engineered into a latex rst directory and the PDF's rebuilt correctly. 
This is hardly feasible when we could just leave two PDF's here. So this is what has been done.
