# Dashboard

## Introduction

This is the dashboard / user interface for HotspotBnB. 
At the moment it is pure html. Users interactions (installing and opening apps) run corresponding cgi scripts.
The cgi scripts install the apps and make changes to this user interface e.g. display newly installed apps etc. 

This is only a short term solution for basic functionality. 
Ideally this whole thing needs to be re-done in React or a similar language.


Future plans include making the interface more like android, where app icons can be renamed, grouped, re-positioned etc.
And adjusting theme e.g. background, color scheme etc. But perhaps wait until its re-done in react first.
