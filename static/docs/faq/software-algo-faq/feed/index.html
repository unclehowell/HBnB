										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the context of HotspotBnB, our algorithm is effectively a calculator of various incoming data sources from the Algorithm website API. The platform then outputs the results of these logical calculation.</p>
<p>All of the platforms which form HotspotBnB, communicate with each other and 3rd party services using API&#8217;s.  Here is a typical plain English conversation the Algorithm Platform will have with the Platforms</p>
<p>Q. Algo has received an alert from Network Status saying a users data is running low (less than 500MB remaining). Network Status, does that Hotspot have credit in its wallet ?</p>
<p>A. (Network Status Replies) Yes. Proceed.</p>
<p>Q. How much ?</p>
<p>A. (Network Status Replies) $20 USD.</p>
<p>Q. Crypto Mining API. What is the current minimum amount required to purchase more data set at?</p>
<p>A. (Crypto Mining Platform replies with the latest figure from 3rd parties e.g. BitRefill) $10 USD</p>
<p>Q. Proceed. Crypto Mining API. What are the top-up amount options available ?</p>
<p>A. (Crypto Mining Platform replies with the latest figure from 3rd parties) $10 USD or $20 USD</p>
<p>======= OK MINING API, INSTRUCT MOST APPROPRIATE 3rd PARTY, TO AUTO-TOP-UP, MOST WE CAN AFFORD AND THAT&#8217;S AVAILABLE e.g. $20 USD. TOP UP THIS SPECIFIC HOTSPOT SIM CARD NUMBER, WHICHEVER NETWORK THEY&#8217;RE ON &#8230;.. GO! AND CONFIRM WHEN COMPLETE, THANKS!  =======</p>
