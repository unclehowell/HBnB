<p>[DOCUMENT DRAFT – PENDING RST (STYLED HTML &amp; PDF) PUBLICATION]</p>
<p><strong>2020</strong></p>
<p>The HotspotBnB company and technology solves the challenge of making internet free, but the technological and commercial solution isn&#8217;t enough to make internet access a truly inalienable birth right. For this reason I am proud to introduce the HotspotBnB Foundation, which will be able to think and work more freely on this challenge.</p>
<p>Firm alliances will be built with political, defence and aid workers in rural areas and developing regions in order to better understand the more chronic reasons why people are offline e.g. poor education, poverty, sickness, sanctions, civil unrest etc. This will be the purpose of the HotspotBnB Foundation.</p>
<p>The Foundation will also manage and fulfill HotspotBnB&#8217;s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Programme. Our foundation has made a commitment to run a new Foundation Initiative with every new software release (roughly every 6 months) to help make internet a free human right throughout the world.</p>
<p>Throughout 2020 our focus will be on establishing ourselves, building alliances, fund raising and getting Initiative 0.1 and 0.2 underway.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://raspberrypi.local/docs/html-pdf/projects-initiatives-2020-q2/">Initiative 0.1</a></strong></p>
<p>This Initiative is already underway and is expected to conclude by 2020/Q2. There are two simple goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>properly account for the 3.2Billion offline by indexing all of their locations on hotspotbnb.com</li>
<li>ensure the HotspotBnB Company proposes specific plans of action to get each of these areas online</li>
</ul>
<p>After Initiative 0.1 concludes the public (prospective network leaseholders) will have a transparent and clearly visible picture of the problem in each region and a clear plan of action to getting these regions online. With a single click the website visitors can effectively give the go ahead to these projects, generating for themselves a 15% APR return on their leasehold network and feel great from witnessing these people coming online before their eyes as a result of their actions.</p>
<p>There are more financially abundant online people than broke offline, and  since this problem of connecting the offline is now an opportunity, this initiative is expected to yield incredible success for all parties and stakeholders.</p>
<p>To be clear the Foundation will only assist with the researching, collation of data and indexing offline locations &#8211; the company will be handling the leaseholding agreements, financing and execution of the projects.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://raspberrypi.local/docs/html-pdf/projects-initiative-2020-q4/">Initiative 0.2</a></strong></p>
<p>This Initiative will begin after Initiative 0.1 is complete, since it is dependent on its completion.  Initiative 0.2 is expected to conclude by 2020/Q2. This initiative has one simple objective:</p>
<ul>
<li>oversee the effects of these communities coming online and report it</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been said, by the United Nations, that bringing the offline community online will bring new economic value in the tens of billions. And since labor = commerce = security it will be interesting to see the contagious and systemic effect of introducing internet access into a community that doesn&#8217;t have it. Not only for the benefit of the region and end-users, but the reports from this initiative should encourage acceleration of repeat-business from existing network leaseholders and attracting of new ones. These leaseholders are crucial to spread of free internet access as they finance the upfront costs of sourcing the hardware, its installation and the initial data packets.</p>
<p>The bet here is on the HotspotBnB company, technology and Listing and Leasing Service, which is expected, in a very short space of time, to become the biggest financier of the Foundation.  My hope is that in 2021 Initiative 0.3 will that of a Foundation with a significant fund to propose new policy in the regions with free internet access. Policy which deems free internet access an inherent and inalienable birth right. With a follow up Initiative to see that this policy is implemented and enforced in these regions with training workshops for public servants e.g. Police and Military would no longer be able to force anyone offline, as it would constitute a rights violation.  Equally Citizens would be education on their new inherent and inalienable rights.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time reading this years public letter from my Foundation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[DOCUMENT DRAFT – PENDING RST (STYLED HTML &amp; PDF) PUBLICATION]</em></p>
<h3 id="ensure-your-charity-is-carrying-out-its-purposes-for-the-public-benefit">1. Ensure the Foundation is carrying out its purposes for the public benefit</h3>
<p>Trustees are to make sure that the HotspotBnB Foundation is carrying out the purposes for which it is set up, and no other purpose. This means Trustees should:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure the Foundations purposes, as set out in its governing document, are understood</li>
<li>properly plan what the Foundation will do, and what the Trustees want those plans to achieve</li>
<li>be prepared to explain how all of the foundations activities are intended to further or support the Foundations purpose(s)</li>
<li>understand how the foundation benefits the public by carrying out its purposes</li>
</ul>
<p>* Spending funds on the wrong purposes is a very serious matter; in some cases trustees may be required to reimburse the foundation personally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="comply-with-your-charitys-governing-document-and-the-law">2. Comply with the Foundations governing document and the law</h3>
<p>Trustees must:</p>
<ul>
<li>make sure that the foundation complies with its governing document</li>
<li>comply with charity law requirements and other laws that apply to the foundation</li>
<li>Take reasonable steps to find out about legal requirements, for example by reading relevant guidance or taking appropriate advice when you need to.</li>
<li>Keep the foundations details on the public register up to date and ensure the right financial and other information is submitted to the commission by way of an annual return or annual update.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="act-in-your-charitys-best-interests">3. Act in the Foundations best interests</h3>
<p>Trustees must:</p>
<ul>
<li>do what trustees (and no one else) decide will best enable the foundation to carry out and carry on its purposes e.g. self-preservation</li>
<li>with fellow trustees, make balanced and adequately informed decisions, thinking about the long term as well as the short term</li>
<li>avoid putting yourself in a position where your duty to the foundation conflicts with personal interests or loyalties to other persons or bodies</li>
<li>not receive any benefit from the charity unless it’s properly vetted, authorised and is size and source of funding is clearly in the charity’s interests; this also includes anyone who is financially connected to trustees e.g. spouses, business associates etc</li>
</ul>
<h3></h3>
<h3 id="manage-your-charitys-resources-responsibly">4. Manage Foundation resources responsibly</h3>
<p>Trustees must act responsibly, reasonably and honestly. This is sometimes called the duty of prudence. Prudence is about exercising sound judgement. Trustees are expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>make sure the Foundations assets are only used to support or carry out its purposes</li>
<li>not take inappropriate risks with the Foundations assets or reputation</li>
<li>not over-commit the foundation</li>
<li>take special care when investing or borrowing</li>
<li>comply with any imposed restrictions on spending</li>
</ul>
<p>Trustees should maintain appropriate procedures and safeguards and take reasonable steps to ensure that the above points are adhered to. Otherwise the trustee risks making the Foundation vulnerable to fraud or theft, or other kinds of abuse, and  breach of duty.</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3 id="act-with-reasonable-care-and-skill">5. Act with reasonable care and skill</h3>
<p>As someone responsible for governing a charitable Foundation, the Trustee:</p>
<ul>
<li>must use reasonable care and skill, making use of your skills and experience and taking appropriate advice when necessary</li>
<li>should give enough time, thought and energy to the role, for example by preparing for, attending and actively participating in all trustees’ meetings</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="ensure-your-charity-is-accountable">6. Ensure the Foundation is accountable</h3>
<p>Trustees are expected to comply with statutory accounting and reporting requirements. Trustees should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>be able to demonstrate that the Foundation is complying with the countries constitution and societies rules, is well run, relevant and effective</li>
<li>ensure appropriate accountability to members</li>
<li>ensure accountability within the Foundation, particularly when delegating  responsibility for particular tasks or decisions to staff or volunteers</li>
</ul>
<h2></h2>
<h3 id="making-decisions-as-a-trustee">Making decisions as a Trustee</h3>
<p>Trustees make decisions about the Foundation together, working as a team. Decisions don’t usually need to be unanimous as long as the majority of trustees agree. These decisions are usually made at the Foundations meetings.</p>
<p>When Trustees make decisions about the Foundation, the Trustee is expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>act within their powers and authority</li>
<li>act in good faith and in the interests of the Foundation</li>
<li>be sufficiently informed, taking professional, accountable and credible  consultation and advice where needed</li>
<li>be aware and take account of all available/ relevant factors</li>
<li>restrict indulging-in and entertaining irrelevant factors</li>
<li>address conflicts of interest and loyalty</li>
<li>make decisions that are within the range of decisions that a reasonable trustee body could make in the circumstances</li>
</ul>
<p>Trustees are expected to record how more series and significant decisions are made, in case the Trustee is asked by a higher authority, to review or explain them in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="chair-and-treasurer-trustee-roles">Chair and Treasurer Trustee Roles</h3>
<p>Some Trustees have special roles, such as the chair and the treasurer. They are known as officers. Trustees must comply with specific provisions in the governing document where it concerns officers. Officers don’t inherently have any extra powers or legal duties than the other Trustee, but may carry out specific roles or have specific responsibilities delegated to them. Don’t forget &#8211; all trustees remain jointly responsible for the charity. For example, all trustees share responsibility for finances (not just the treasurer).</p>
<h2></h2>
<h3 id="when-trustees-can-be-personally-liable">When Trustees can be Personally Liable</h3>
<p>It’s extremely rare, but not impossible, for Trustees to be held personally liable:</p>
<ul>
<li>to the Foundation, if they cause a financial loss by acting improperly</li>
<li>to a 3rd party that has a legal claim against the Foundation, for which the Foundation cannot, or is otherwise not legally obligated to meet</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding potential liabilities will help you to protect yourself, your fellow Trustees and the Foundation, by taking appropriate action to reduce the risk. This includes, but is not restricted to, complying with the aforementioned duties.</p>
