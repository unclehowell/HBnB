<p>[DOCUMENT DRAFT – PENDING RST (STYLED HTML &#038; PDF) PUBLICATION]</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
This Whitepaper is a persuasive, authoritative, in-depth report of a problem to be solved and the proposed solution itself e.g. HotspotBnB. By reviewing this document the reader will become educated about the issue and and how the  proposed HotspotBnB platform intends to remedy it. Ultimately this document is a guide to solving a problem.</p>
<p>The challenge being faced is making internet access free for the 3.2Billion people still not online in 2020. The core problem of this challenge according to the United Nations is affordability. In most cases the lack of adoption of internet access appears to be because the cost of data (1Gb) is higher than 2% of the offline populations monthly income, which has historically been the breakpoint to internet adoption. </p>
<p>Our organisation got to work on this challenge in 2012 and after years of R&#038;D, patents from Google and work with reputable companies such as DD-WRT, a free internet solution was developed. Our cellular to wireless hotspots are able to top themselves up by taking advertising and cryptocurrency mining revenue (from connected devices) and autonomously pass it to the Internet Service Provider using cryptocurrency smart contracts. Furthermore a profit can be made from the abundance of revenue between the funds generated and the cost of the average monthly data being consumed. </p>
<p>While our organisation has successfully developed an early stage technology to provide free internet access, there still exists a cost for the initial hardware, connection and data packet, which presents another cost barrier. HotspotBnB solves this, hopefully final problem, by allowing the online population to lease own parts of our new free internet networks, for a period of between 6 and 36 months, with a revenue-share and Return on Investment of 15% APR. Ultimately this creates an ongoing stream of upfront capital and spreads the liability over a longer term, effectively crowdsourcing the risk and returns involved in getting the offline world fully connected. </p>
<p>Each module of the platform is to be seperated and will communicate with corresponding modules and 3rd party services via API&#8217;s. For example, the way in which the internet service provides are paid with cryptocurrency uses a 3rd party services such as BitRefill, which can be communicated with by API. So the software of the wireless hotspots, more specifically the application (not the operating system), must supply the sim card phone number and wallet balance via API to our platform. An algorithm will assess many factors, such as the wallet balance meeting the minimal top-up amount, and if the credit balance constitutes a Quality of Service script alteration to allow for higher speed, video, voice etc. </p>
<p>The HotspotBnB service works on what we&#8217;re calling an upward spiral. Initially the end-user will have USSD and Free Basics access. USSD is a cellular channel which doesn&#8217;t cost us much ($5 a year) and can be used for IoT, MQTT. Free Basics provides Facebook and Wikipedia and many other popular websites and online services (including banking and healthcare) for free. Furthermore the hotspot contains offline self-hosted mobile-web applications such as gaming, home control, media library and ipcctv. As the end-user indulges in this rich free internet basic service, cryptocurrency is mined and ads are served, which generates more data and unlocks higher speeds and layers such as voice, larger file downloads and video streaming e.g. IPTV, Face-to-Face video calls, YouTube etc. </p>
<p>The initial layers and services offer an offline person an incredible amount of internet for free, while generating revenue and subsequently data in order to provide an even richer experience. But as the experience gets richer e.g. IPTV, large file downloads etc the assurance that revenue and data can be generated (equal to or greater than the amount being consumed) is less assured, which risks leaving HotspotBnB in deficit, not profit. But as the operating system and application on the wireless hotspot develops, and as the revenue generation is improved, its expected the experience will not differ to a 1st world persons online experience. Furthermore it&#8217;s expected that this solution will gradually move into 1st world spaces, since even 1st world surfers would prefer to pay nothing for internet, specifically elderly and more casual users which won&#8217;t be so interested in the larger file downloading or high definition of the iptv. </p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
A freely sourced wireless hotspot, able to generate its own funds from day to day usage, and top itself up autonomously, while generating a profit for its owner(s), creator(s) and financeer(s), would inevitably hold an extraordinary quantitative value. Particularly if hundreds of millions of people aggressively adopt the solution in a revolutionary global movement towards free internet access inevitability becoming an inalienable birth right &#8211; as oppose to its current status as the affordable (and revokeable) paid privilege it actually is!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been said that the size of an ice cream serving can only determined when the scoop hits the bottom of the container. To quantify the value of a technology solution, able to make internet access free, is not too difference to this analogy. The exploration conducted so far (&#8216;the ice cream scoop&#8217;) has not yet &#8216;reached the bottom of the container&#8217; so to speak, so it is still unclear how big of an opportunity this is. But as the solution develops year on year, through agonizing months of largely trial and error, a picture is beginning to emerge and the full scope of the opportunity value is becoming clear.</p>
<p>In the run-up to this free internet solution becoming a reality, the determination of the quantitative value at any given phase of development, can be difficult to determine. Oxford University once held an economics demonstration to determine the value of any item based on its supply and demand e.g. the basics of economics. In this respect equity in the technology has been freely traded based on confidence in the project, and mainly that of reputable defence telecommunications engineers. This organically shaped a real-time valuation of the technology since R&amp;D begun in 2012, but trades can be infrequent and volatile and in most instances the investors have the funds and inclination to invest, but despite the trade experience have no professional investment knowledge to fully assess the estimated value. This has lead to investors (who are in actual fact engineers) following the previous (in terms of purchase price per share), which has served only to corrupt the Oxford standard of a supply/demand based value.</p>
<p>The Oxford method of the previous years sharetrading is now to become one of many factors in this assessment report. These reports will attempt to reflect proper due-diligence of this technology, at its current stage of development, in a way any reasonable person would asses and estimate the valuation based on the available information at the time. This is now possible since the entire document library relating to this technology, including project documents, are version controlled and centrally located, so a 360 snapshot of the business and technology is able to be taken more easily. And more importantly, with points of reference. Once the technology is operational, performance reports will replace these assessments and their speculative nature, but in the interim these assessments do one better than the failed Oxford supply/demand method. Furthermore these documents and the document template itself is able to be easily modified based on feedback and professional consultation, so the assessment itself will only continue to become more accurate and dependable, giving investors an aid in their school of thought when determining the value of HotspotBnB for purposes of investment. On a final note, the annual accounts require a quantitative value for the asset in order to produce financial reports which more accurately reflect the reality.</p>
