Our vision
------------------

**The United Nations once estimated that by 2020 the entire world would be online. The year has arrived, yet 3.2 Billion people are still without internet access. New reports indicate it may actually now take until 2050 to get everyone online.**

The ideal remedy to this problem would be a solution which makes internet access free for end-users while simultaniously compensating the internet service providers for maintaining the network, e.g. advertising revenue etc. Sadly the road to such a solution is littered with the carcasus of companies which have all tried and failed at this, including Facebook and Google. This is fast becoming one of the biggest humanitarian and commercial opportunities of our time.

HotspotBnB® has been a silent underdog in this race. Origionally called Wave, this project was founded and financed by a team of British Defence Communications Engineers back in 2012, with a plan to develop the worlds first free internet solution. By 2017 HotspotBnB® earnt itself several international patents and a Loon Balloon contract from Google. HotspotBnB.com builds on these successes, taking humanity a further step closer to free internet access.  

HotspotBnB® offers Wi-Fi hotspots which top themselves up, using advertising revenue and cryptocurrency smart contracts. The solution is able to generate a profit. Furthermore HotspotBnB's website allows anyone to lease-own these public Wi-Fi hotspots and share the profits as part of a 3 - 36 leasehold agreement. Profits depend on a number of factors including the cost of data in the region where the hotspot exists, the population density and demographics of audiences and even the redundant processing power of connected mobile devices. 

This whitepaper aims to provide the reader with a proper understanding of how HotspotBnB® works. The document will be revised to maintain an acurate and current representation of the technology platform.

Our Belief
############

We believe a fully connected world is a better one. When you empower anyone with internet access their ability to contribute and generate value for themselves and their society, grows exponentially. 

HotspotBnB® sees itself bridging the gap between hundreds of millions of people without internet and a modern world of digital service providers, which until now have been struggling to reach offline and off-grid people in a commercially viable way. 

This all begins with an online index of all the regions in the world without internet access, overlayed with real plans for introducing infrastructure to these regions, including ready-to-go products, humanitarian aid workers and engineers in the region.  

Every aspect of HotspotBnB's wireless communications infrastructure differs from existing telecommunications infrastructure. Our hardware is pioneering in energy efficiency, speed and durability. We also developed our own operating system and applications to operate these pioneering products. Furthermore we have an entire suite of online portals for our partners in advertising, cryptocurrency mining, humanitarian aid and defence. 


WaveOS™ is free and open-source (GitHub). The latest compiled version of the software is also free to download from our website for anyone already in possession of a Single Board Computer e.g. Raspberry Pi - `https://wave.hotspotbnb.com/download.html <https://wave.hotspotbnb.com/download.html>`__.
