## Introduction

Wave is the former name of the HotspotBnB Project. 
This directory contains the origional Wave (static HTML) website. 

Before the project grew to include a server side, this static HTML website was sufficient. It is now kept for historical and reference purposes only. 

Ideally we would want to keep this on GitHub and use GitHub Pages for free hosting of the website. But due to the overriding need of a monorepo, in which this Wave website must reside within a subdirectory, GitHub Pages is no longer suitable, since the site must exist in the top level directory or in a docs.
