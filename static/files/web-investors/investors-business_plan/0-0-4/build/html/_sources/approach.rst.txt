In order to enact this working agreement it will now be distributed to the 50+ owners of the Wave Telecom technology platform for review and approval. Since the top 5 shareholders have the controlling vote, this investment plan has already been agreed in principle. To conclude this new understanding, the first investment installment of almost 66,000 GBP was received by Wave Telecom on the 20th February 2015. Distribution of this document is now somewhat of a formality and courtesy, so as the board of shareholders can remain aware of the business teams activities where it concerns them and their equity in this private trust. This document also highlights the need to and one or two new investors, who's funds will help subsidise securities exchange for the Series B investment round goal. This subsidising of the security exchange fund raising performance, which is necessary in order to fulfil the first of 12 desired outcomes that inevitably result in a sum of 3 million USD being invested into Wave before 2016. With respect to the technological approach, the firmware is now on route from DD-WRT and the rebranding of Wave to WifeEye has already begun. 

The method by which seed/startup sellers obtain Funds from this memorandum, is to list the saie of their equity in the Series A investment schedule. In accordance with this schedule the Series A investor will deposit funds in exchange for equity. The seller must simply log into Wave and give instruction of transfer of these funds to their bank.
